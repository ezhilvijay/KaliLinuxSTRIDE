# Feedback on 22/10/22

* Very nice narrative descripton, good level of detail
* Excellent usage of emphasis and structuring
* The actual impact could be detailed a bit more: "Itâ€™s estimated that organisations collectively lost $1 billion" -> how did they lose that money? 
* Excellent to include the vulnerability with CVE (although the two should probably be together) as well as the exploit!
* It's good to have references, but it would be much better to cite inline the text, to support the different claims. 
* Good identification and usage of STRIDE, although it would be good to have a bit more details explaining why it's a tampering threat.
