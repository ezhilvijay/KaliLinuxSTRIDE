# Feedback on 23/10/22

* Good attack description, concise and explaining clearly what happened. 
* No information is provided about the attacker, but it's not clear if it's because it's not unknown, even more than a year after the attack? 
* It's not clear which vulnerability was used. 
* STRIDE: you don't have to identify each part of STRIDE in the attack, but rather to focuse on the main points. In addition, the threat should focus on the attack itself rather than the potential vulnerability used. 
For instance, "If the TeamViewer access was obtained by using a legitimate userâ€™s login credentials, it is possible that this information was not kept sufficiently secure to prevent access by malicious actors" -> 
even though it is indeed possible that the attack was made possible by a previous information disclosure, the attack itself is not about information disclosure. 
* Very nice usage of references and good explanation of the resulting measures!
